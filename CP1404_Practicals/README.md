- I have learned about the formats used by different types of parts of a program to make it easy to understand the functionality of it by breaking down the problem and solving one part at a time in a specific area.
- I have learned to use pseudocode to simplify the coding process,creating an easy-to-understand code for people to view my code for the first time.
- I have learned to keep my code as simple as possible without making it complicated, to prevent errors and easier to be understood.
