Quick Questions
1.  Constants should be declared at the top and all characters should be in capital form.
2.  Global variables make debugging difficult. Functions that use global variables are usually dependent on those variables, which makes it hard to transfer to another program
3.  Scope
4.  Breakpoints are special markers that suspend program execution at a specific point. This lets you examine the program state and behavior.
5.  This would mean that we are increasing the value of the variable before even assigning it a value. This causes a Name error as we cannot assign a variable to itself while increasing its value since we do not know its initial variable value itself.
6.  Single Responsibility Principal. Each function should only perform a single task. This makes it easier to call functions and repeat the use of functions

3. Problem Decomposition: Breaking down a complex problem into smaller problems and working on a solution for each of them rather than the main problem helps build motivation and a sense of success
