"""CP1401 - Practical 10 - Debugging.
Explain the problems (not the solution, not the style issues):
...
Line 27 Gets a long value that is shown in the output
Line 46 upper value has to be changed as it has a value which is incorrect
Line 60 Value is only returned in one decision structure value

Describe your debugging process:
Line by line decoding and understanding each and every syntax and checking a few values after printing them and seeing what's wrong.


Fix the code in-place below
