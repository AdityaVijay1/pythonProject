Q1

Noun: The hourly dosage,hours,total dosage

Verb: get the hourly dosage,hours
      calculate,display


Algorithm:
get hourly dosage,hours

total dosage= hourly dosage*hours

display total dosage



Q2.
Noun= customer's name, date of the booking, unique booking id, hourly charge, number of hours, charge

Verb= calculate, generate,display


Algorithm:
get customer's name, date of booking, hourly charge, number of hours

Charge = hourly charge*number of hours

Unique booking id = generated from customer's name and date of booking

display charge, unique booking id


Q3.
Noun= distance travelled(kilometre), travel time(minutes), average speed(kilometre/hour)

Verb= calculate,display


Algorithm:
get distance travelled(kilometre), travel time(minutes)

travel time(hour) = travel time(minute)/60

average speed(kilometre/hour) = distance travelled(kilometre)/travel time(hour)

display average speed
